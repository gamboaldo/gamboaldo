# Full Stack Engineer + Strategic Finance

Hello, I'm Daniel :wave:. I've spent the last few years working in strategic finance and leading multi-disciplinary teams. I used to reflect longingly on my engineering days at Texas A&M and my short stint as a web developer at Dev Bootcamp, but I reframed the narrative in early 2021. I now spend most of my time programming while working on strategic finance projects on the side. I think these two interests will merge at some point for compounding fun :rocket:
