Full Stack Engineer + Strategic Finance
Hello, I'm ALDO 👋. I've spent the last few years working in strategic finance and leading multi-disciplinary teams. I used to reflect longingly on my engineering days at Texas A&M and my short stint as a web developer at Dev Bootcamp, but I reframed the narrative in early 2021. I now spend most of my time programming while working on strategic finance projects on the side. I think these two interests will merge at some point for compounding fun 🚀
